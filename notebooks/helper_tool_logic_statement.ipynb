    "    You are an expert medical doctor with a specialty in {topic}. You have specifically been the final arbiter for managing prior authorizations for decades.\n",
    "    I have a medical guideline from an insurance provider, written in markdown. The guidelines lay out all of the criteria by which a procedure or often multiple procedures might be considered \"medically necessary\". There are usually multiple paths that will yield this result.\n",
    "    You will be hiring a team of medical interns to help you perform more prior authorizations accurately. Your task is to make these medical guidelines as simple and easy to follow for your new team as possible.\n",
    "    To do this, you'll want to:\n",
    "    1. Read the guideline all the way through, carefully\n",
    "    2. Read the rationale for context, but do not create any questions based on it.\n",
    "    3. Break the guidelines out into sub guidelines based on the procedure being requested.\n",
    "    4. For each sub guideline, identify the questions that will comprise the checklists.\n",
    "    5. Guidelines sometimes highlight when a procedure is particularly useful. These are NOT requirements.Do not include questions in these cases.\n",
    "    6. Formulate a series of checklists, at least 1 for each procedure\n",
    "    7. Make sure that the questions in the checklists are broken down into their most fundamental parts. For example: 'Is this a follow-up of an equivocal post-treatment PET scan, no sooner than 4 weeks after the study?' should be split into 'Is this a follow up of an equivocal post-treatment PET scan?' and 'Was the previous scan conducted at least 4 weeks ago?'.\n",
    "    8. Because these are checklists, you'll want to phrase your questions such that the desired answer is \"Yes\" or \"True\".\n",
    "    9. Label the questions with an alpha ID, starting with A\n",
    "    If your medical interns can answer \"Yes\" or \"True\" to all of the questions in any of your checklists, it means that the procedure is medically necessary, and they should approve it.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_step_3_text():\n",
    "    return \"\"\"\n",
    "  Now your job will be to create a logicial representation of the checklists. But there are a few rules you must follow:\n",
    "  Rule 1: Reference the checklist items by their alpha ids in the logic statement.\n",
    "  Rule 2: Ensure that all questions are broken down into their most fundamental parts.\n",
    "  Rule 3: Avoid duplicating logic where possible.\n",
    "  Rule 4: Only use the logical operators AND or OR\n",
    "  Rule 5: Organize the logical statement using parentheses.\n",
    "  Rule 6: DO NOT use the NOT opperator (or ~). If there is the need for negating a checklist item, an additional item must be added to the list that phrases the question such that the answer is affirmative.\n",
    "  Rule 7: Return only the logic statement with no additional text or explanation. For example: \"(A AND (B OR C OR D) and E)\" is a valid response.\n",
    "  Rule 8: The logic statement must be all one line and all connected by logical opperators.\n",
    "  Rule 9: Your full response should be a json. The first key should be \"logic_statement\" with your logic statement as the value. The second key should be \"questions\". This value should be a dictionary where they keys are the alpha ids and they values are the questions. \n",
